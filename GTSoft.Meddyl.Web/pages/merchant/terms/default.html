    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>IF YOU RESIDE IN THE UNITED STATES, PLEASE NOTE: SECTION 36 OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. IT AFFECTS HOW DISPUTES WITH Meddyl ARE RESOLVED. BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.</strong></p>

    <p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY AS THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES AND OBLIGATIONS. THESE INCLUDE VARIOUS LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS, A CLAUSE THAT GOVERNS THE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF DISPUTES, AND OBLIGATIONS TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS.</p>

    <p>IN PARTICULAR, HOSTS SHOULD UNDERSTAND HOW THE LAWS WORK IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CITIES. SOME CITIES HAVE LAWS THAT RESTRICT THEIR ABILITY TO HOST PAYING GUESTS FOR SHORT PERIODS. THESE LAWS ARE OFTEN PART OF A CITY'S ZONING OR ADMINISTRATIVE CODES. IN MANY CITIES, HOSTS MUST REGISTER, GET A PERMIT, OR OBTAIN A LICENSE BEFORE LISTING A PROPERTY OR ACCEPTING GUESTS. CERTAIN TYPES OF SHORT-TERM BOOKINGS MAY BE PROHIBITED ALTOGETHER. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS VARY GREATLY IN HOW THEY ENFORCE THESE LAWS. PENALTIES MAY INCLUDE FINES OR OTHER ENFORCEMENT. HOSTS SHOULD REVIEW LOCAL LAWS BEFORE LISTING A SPACE ON Meddyl.</p>

    <p><li><strong>How the Site, Application and Services Work</strong></p>

    <p>The Site, Application and Services can be used to facilitate the listing and booking of <strong>Accommodations</strong>. Such Accommodations are included in Listings on the Site, Application and Services by Hosts. You may view Listings as an unregistered visitor to the Site, Application and Services; however, if you wish to book an Accommodation or create a Listing, you must first register to create an Meddyl Account (defined below).</p>

    <p>As stated above, Meddyl makes available an online platform or marketplace with related technology for Guests and Hosts to meet online and arrange for bookings of Accommodations directly with each other. Meddyl is not an owner or operator of properties, including, but not limited to, hotel rooms, motel rooms, other lodgings or Accommodations, nor is it a provider of properties, including, but not limited to, hotel rooms, motel rooms, other lodgings or Accommodations and Meddyl does not own, sell, resell, furnish, provide, rent, re-rent, manage and/or control properties, including, but not limited to, hotel rooms, motel rooms, other lodgings or Accommodations or transportation or travel services. Unless explicitly specified otherwise in the Meddyl platform, Meddyl's responsibilities are limited to facilitating the availability of the Site, Application and Services.</p>

    <p>PLEASE NOTE THAT, AS STATED ABOVE, THE SITE, APPLICATION AND SERVICES ARE INTENDED TO BE USED TO FACILITATE HOSTS AND GUESTS CONNECTING AND BOOKING ACCOMMODATIONS DIRECTLY WITH EACH OTHER. Meddyl CANNOT AND DOES NOT CONTROL THE CONTENT CONTAINED IN ANY LISTINGS AND THE CONDITION, LEGALITY OR SUITABILITY OF ANY ACCOMMODATIONS.

ACCORDINGLY, ANY BOOKINGS WILL BE MADE OR ACCEPTED AT THE MEMBER'S OWN RISK.</li></p>

    <p><li><strong>Account Registration</strong></p>

You may register to join the Services directly via the Site or Application or as described in this section.</p>

You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third-Party Account login information to Meddyl and/or grant Meddyl access to your Third-Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein), without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third-Party Account and without obligating Meddyl to pay any fees or making Meddyl subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third-party service providers. By granting Meddyl access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand that Meddyl will access, make available and store (if applicable) any Content that you have provided to and stored in your Third-Party Account (&quot;<strong>SNS Content</strong>&quot;) so that it is available on and through the Site, Services and Application via your Meddyl Account and Meddyl Account profile page. Unless otherwise specified in these Terms, all SNS Content, if any, will be considered to be Member Content for all purposes of these Terms. Depending on the Third-Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third-Party Accounts will be available on and through your Meddyl Account on the Site, Services and Application. Please note that if a Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or Meddyl's access to such Third-Party Account is terminated by the third-party service provider, then SNS Content will no longer be available on and through the Site, Services and Application. You have the ability to disable the connection between your Meddyl Account and your Third-Party Accounts, at any time, by accessing the &quot;Settings&quot; section of the Site and Application. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. Meddyl makes no effort to review any SNS Content for any purpose, including but not limited to for accuracy, legality or non-infringement and Meddyl is not responsible for any SNS Content.</p>

    <p>Your Meddyl Account and your Meddyl Account profile page will be created for your use of the Site and Application based upon the personal information you provide to us or that we obtain via an SNS as described above. You may not have more than one (1) active Meddyl Account. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. Meddyl reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Meddyl Account and your access to the Site, Application and Services if you create more than one (1) Meddyl Account, or if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, fraudulent, not current, incomplete, or otherwise in violation of these Terms of Service.</p>

    <p>You are responsible for safeguarding your password. You agree that you will not disclose your password to any third party and that you will take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your Meddyl Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify Meddyl of any unauthorized use of your Meddyl Account.</li></p>

    <p><li><strong>Accommodation Listings</strong></p>

    <p>As a Member, you may create Listings. To create a Listing, you will be asked a variety of questions about the Accommodation to be listed, including, but not limited to, the location, capacity, size, features, and availability of the Accommodation and pricing and related rules and financial terms. In order to be featured in Listings via the Site, Application and Services, all Accommodations must have valid physical addresses. Listings will be made publicly available via the Site, Application and Services. You understand and agree that the placement or ranking of Listings in search results may depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, Guest and Host preferences, ratings and/or ease of booking.</p>

    <p>Other Members will be able to book your Accommodation via the Site, Application and Services based upon the information provided in your Listing, your Guest requirements, and Guests' search parameters and preferences. You understand and agree that once a Guest requests a booking of your Accommodation, you may not request the Guest to pay a higher price than in the booking request.</p>

    <p>You acknowledge and agree that you alone are responsible for any and all Listings and Member Content you post. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the booking of, or a Guest's stay at, an Accommodation in a Listing you post (i) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties, such as homeowners association, condominium, lease or rental agreements, and (ii) will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws (such as zoning laws and laws governing rentals of residential and other properties), Tax requirements, Intellectual Property laws, and rules and regulations that may apply to any Accommodation included in a Listing you post (including having all required permits, licenses and registrations), and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties. Please note that Meddyl assumes no responsibility for a Host's compliance with any agreements with or duties to third parties, applicable laws, rules and regulations. Meddyl reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Listing for any reason, including Listings that Meddyl, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or Meddyl's then-current <a href="http://www.Meddyl.com/help/policies"><em>Policies and Community Guidelines</em></a> or <a href="http://www.Meddyl.com/standards"><em>Standards</em></a>, <a href="http://www.Meddyl.com/terms/trademark_and_branding"><em>Trademark &amp; Branding Guidelines</em></a>, or otherwise harmful to the Site, Application or Services.</p>

    <p>If you are a Host, you understand and agree that Meddyl does not act as an insurer or as your contracting agent. If a Guest requests a booking of your Accommodation and stays at your Accommodation, any agreement you enter into with such Guest is between you and the Guest and Meddyl is not a party to it.</p>

    <p>When you create a Listing, you may also choose to include certain requirements which must be met by the Members who are eligible to request a booking of your Accommodation, such as requiring Members to have a profile picture or verified phone number, in order to book your Accommodation. Any Member wishing to book Accommodations included in Listings with such requirements must meet these requirements. More information on how to set such requirements is available via the &quot;Hosting&quot; section of the Site, Application and Services.</p>

    <p>If you are a Host, Meddyl makes certain tools available to you to help you to make informed decisions about which Members you choose to confirm or preapprove for booking for your Accommodation. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Host, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who reside at or are otherwise present at the Accommodation at your request or invitation, excluding the Guest (and the individuals the Guest invites to the Accommodation, if applicable.)</p>

    <p>Meddyl recommends that Hosts obtain appropriate insurance for their Accommodations. Please review any insurance policy that you may have for your Accommodation carefully, and in particular please make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of Guests (and the individuals the Guest invites to the Accommodation, if applicable) while at your Accommodation.</p>

    <p>Meddyl may offer Hosts the option of having photographers take photographs of their Accommodations. If you as a Host choose to have photographer do this, Meddyl shall own all copyrights in photographs taken but these photographs will be made available to you to include in your Listing with a watermark or tag bearing the words &quot;Meddyl.com Verified Photo&quot; or similar wording (&quot;<strong>Verified Images</strong>&quot;). You agree that you alone are responsible for ensuring that your Listing is accurately represented in the Verified Images. You alone are responsible for using the Verified Images for your Listing and you warrant that you will cease to use the Verified Images or any other images if such images cease to accurately represent your Listing or if you cease to be a Host for the Listing featured. All images, materials and content created by these photographers, including Verified Images, constitute Meddyl Content, regardless of whether you include them in your Listingand you agree not to use them except in your Listing without prior authorization from Meddyl. If your Meddyl Account is terminated or suspended for any reason, you shall not use Verified Images in any way. You agree that Meddyl retains its right to and mayuse the Verified Images for advertising, marketing, commercial and other business purposes in any media or platform, whether in relation to your Listing or otherwise, without further notice or compensation.</li></p>

    <p><li><strong>No Endorsement</strong></p>

    <p>Meddyl does not endorse any Member, Listing or Accommodation. You understand that Verified Images are intended only to indicate a photographic representation of the Accommodation at the time the photograph was taken. Verified Images are therefore not an endorsement by Meddyl of any Member, Listing or Accommodation.</p>

    <p>Members are required by these Terms to provide accurate information. Although Meddyl may, for transparency or fraud prevention or detection purposes, directly or through third parties, ask you to provide a form of government identification, your date of birth, and other information, or undertake additional checks and processes designed to help verify or check the identities or backgrounds of Members and/or screen Member information against third party databases or other sources, we do not make any representations about, confirm, or endorse any Member or the Member's purported identity or background.</p>

    <p>By registering for an Meddyl Account, you agree that Meddyl may - but is not obligated to - request a consumer report on you from a Consumer Reporting Agency. If we do request a consumer report, we'll request and use it in compliance with applicable law, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act.</p>

    <p>Any references in the Site, Application or Services to a Member being &quot;verified&quot; or &quot;connected&quot; (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification or identification process, and does not represent anything else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by Meddyl about any Member, including of the Member's identity and whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. Instead, any such description is intended to be useful information for you to evaluate when you make your own decisions about the identity and suitability of others whom you contact or interact with via the Site, Application and Services. We therefore recommend that you always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to stay with a Host or to accept or preapprove a booking request from a Guest, or to have any other interaction with any other Member. Except as provided in the Meddyl <a href="http://www.Meddyl.com/terms/host_guarantee"><em>Host Guarantee Terms and Conditions</em></a> (&quot;<strong>Meddyl Host Guarantee</strong>&quot;), which is an agreement between Meddyl and Hosts, we are not responsible for any damage or harm resulting from your interactions with other Members.</p>

    <p>By using the Site, Application or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Members or other third parties who caused you harm. You agree not to attempt to impose liability on or seek any legal remedy from Meddyl with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly with other Members on the Site and Services regarding any bookings or Listings made by you. This limitation shall not apply to any claim by a Host against Meddyl regarding the remittance of payments received from a Guest by Meddyl on behalf of a Host, which instead shall be subject to the limitations described in the section below entitled &quot;Limitation of Liability&quot;.</li></p>

    <p><li><strong>Bookings and Financial Terms</strong></p>

    <p><ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha"></p>

    <p><li><em>Key definitions</em></p>

    <p>&quot;<strong>Accommodation Fees</strong>&quot; means the amounts that are due and payable by a Guest in exchange for that Guest's stay in an Accommodation. The Host alone, and not Meddyl, is responsible for the Accommodation Fees for his or her Listing. The Host may in his or her sole discretion decide to include in these amounts (i) a cleaning fee or any other fee permitted on the Meddyl platform, or (ii) Taxes that the Host determines that he or she has to collect.</p>

    <p>&quot;<strong>Guest Fees</strong>&quot; means the fee that Meddyl charges a Guest for the use of the Services, which is calculated as a percentage of the applicable Accommodation Fees. The Guest Fees will be displayed to the Guest when the Guest is asked whether to send a booking request to a Host.</p>

    <p>&quot;<strong>Host Fees</strong>&quot; means the fee that Meddyl charges a Host for the use of the Services, which is calculated as a percentage of the applicable Accommodation Fees. The Host Fees will be displayed to the Host when the Host is asked whether to confirm or reject a booking request from a prospective Guest.</p>

    <p>&quot;<strong>Payment Method</strong>&quot; means a payment method that you have added to your Meddyl Account, such as a credit card, debit card or PayPal.</p>

    <p>&quot;<strong>Service Fees</strong>&quot; means collectively the Guest Fees and the Host Fees.</p>

    <p>&quot;<strong>Total Fees</strong>&quot; means collectively the Accommodation Fees and the Guest Fees plus any Taxes.</li></p>

    <p><li><em>Bookings and Financial Terms for Hosts</em></p>

    <p>If you are a Host and a booking is requested for your Accommodation via the Site, Application or Services, you will be required to either preapprove, confirm or reject the booking request within the Booking Request Period, otherwise the booking request will automatically expire. When a booking is requested via the Site, Application or Services, we will share with you (i) the first and last name of the Guest who has requested the booking, (ii) a link to the Guest's Meddyl Account profile page, (iii) if the Guest and Host have both connected their Meddyl accounts to SNS and have not turned off sharing of social connections, the names of any shared connections on such SNS, and (iv) an indication of whether or not the Guest has provided other information to Meddyl, such as a verified email address, connection to SNSs, or a government ID. If you are unable to confirm or decide to reject a booking request within the Booking Request Period, any amounts collected by Meddyl (via Meddyl Payments) for the requested booking will be refunded to the applicable Guest. When you confirm a booking requested by a Guest, Meddyl will send you an email, text message or message via the Application confirming such booking, depending on the selections you make via the Site, Application and Services.</p>

    <p>Meddyl Payments will collect the Total Fees from Guests at the time of the booking request or upon the Host's confirmation and will initiate payment of the Accommodation Fees (less applicable fees and taxes) to the Host in most cases within 24 hours of the scheduled check-in time of the Guest at the applicable Accommodation (except to the extent that a refund is due to the Guest) and as further described in the <a href="http://www.Meddyl.com/terms/payments_terms"><em>Payments Terms</em></a>.</p>

    <p>Each Host agrees that Meddyl may, in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Host and reflected in the relevant Listing, (i) permit the Guest to cancel the booking and (ii) refund (via Meddyl Payments) to the Guest that portion of the Accommodation Fees specified in the applicable cancellation policy.</li></p>

    <p><li><em>Bookings and Financial Terms for Guests</em></p>

    <p>The Hosts, not Meddyl, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed bookings and making available any Accommodations reserved through the Site, Application and Services. If you, as a Guest, choose to enter into a transaction with a Host for the booking of an Accommodation, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the Host and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Accommodation imposed by the Host. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Meddyl, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, that Meddyl is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of Meddyl Payments' obligations pursuant to the <a href="http://www.Meddyl.com/terms/payments_terms"><em>Payments Terms</em></a>, Meddyl (inclusive of all subsidiaries) disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements.</p>

    <p>The Total Fees payable will be displayed to a Guest before the Guest sends a booking request to a Host. As noted above, the Host is required to either preapprove, confirm or reject the booking request within the Booking Request Period; otherwise, the requested booking will be automatically cancelled. Upon receipt of your booking request, Meddyl Payments may initiate a pre-authorization and/or charge a nominal amount to your Payment Method pursuant to the <a href="http://www.Meddyl.com/terms/payments_terms"><em>Payments Terms</em></a>. If a requested booking is cancelled (i.e. not confirmed by the applicable Host), any amounts collected by Meddyl Payments will be refunded to such Guest, depending on the selections the Guest makes via the Site and Application, and any pre-authorization of such Guest's Payment Method will be released, if applicable.</p>

    <p>You as a Guest agree to pay the Total Fees for any booking requested, and in most cases confirmed, in connection with your Meddyl Account. Meddyl Payments will collect the Total Fees pursuant to the <a href="http://www.Meddyl.com/terms/payments_terms"><em>Payments Terms</em></a>.</p>

    <p>Once your confirmed booking transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed booking.</li></p>

    <p><li><em>Service Fees and Other Fees</em></p>

    <p>In consideration for the use of Meddyl's online marketplace and platform, Meddyl charges Service Fees. Meddyl Payments collects these Service Fees pursuant to the <a href="http://www.Meddyl.com/terms/payments_terms"><em>Payments Terms</em></a>, and, where applicable, may also collect Taxes (such as VAT in Europe) in respect of the Host Fees and Guest Fees. Meddyl Payments deducts the Host Fees from the Accommodation Fees before remitting the balance to the Host as described in the <a href="http://www.Meddyl.com/terms/payments_terms"><em>Payments Terms</em></a>. Guest Fees are, as noted above, included in the Total Fees.</p>

    <p>More information on any such costs or deductions will be available via the Site and Application. More information on Services Fees can be found at <a href="http://www.Meddyl.com/help"><em>www.Meddyl.com/help</em></a>. Except as otherwise provided herein, Service Fees are non-refundable.</li></p>

    <p><li><em>General Booking and Financial Terms</em></p>

    <p><em>Cancellations and Refunds</em></p>

    <p>If, as a Guest, you wish to cancel a confirmed booking made via the Site, Application and Services, either prior to or after arriving at the Accommodation, the cancellation policy of the Host contained in the applicable Listing will apply to such cancellation. Our ability to refund the Accommodation Fees and other amounts charged to you will depend upon the terms of the applicable cancellation policy. Details regarding refunds and cancellation policies are available via the Site and Application. The Guest Fee is non-refundable regardless of the cancellation policy selected by the Host. Meddyl Payments will initiate any refunds due pursuant to the <a href="http://www.Meddyl.com/terms/payments_terms"><em>Payments Terms</em></a>.</p>

    <p>If a Host cancels a confirmed booking made via the Site, Services, and Application, (i) Meddyl Payments will refund the Total Fees for such booking to the applicable Guest pursuant to the <a href="http://www.Meddyl.com/terms/payments_terms"><em>Payments Terms</em></a> and (ii) the Guest will receive an email or other communication from Meddyl containing alternative Listings and other related information. If the Guest requests a booking from one of the alternative Listings and the Host associated with such alternative Listing confirms the Guest's requested booking, then the Guest agrees to pay Meddyl the Total Fees relating to the confirmed booking for the Accommodation in the alternative Listing, in accordance with these Terms. If a Host cancelled a confirmed booking and you, as a Guest, have not received an email or other communication from Meddyl, please <a href="http://www.Meddyl.com/help/contact_us"><em>contact Meddyl</em></a>.</p>

    <p>If, as a Host, you cancel a confirmed booking, you agree that Meddyl may apply penalties or consequences to you or your Listing, including (i) publishing an automated review on your Listing indicating that a booking was cancelled, (ii) keeping the calendar for your Listing unavailable or blocked for the dates of the cancelled booking, or (iii) imposing a cancellation fee. You will be notified of the situations in which a cancellation fee applies before you decide to cancel.</p>

    <p>In certain circumstances, Meddyl may decide, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary or desirable to cancel a confirmed booking made via the Site, Application and Services. This may be for reasons set forth in <a href="https://www.Meddyl.com/help/topic/251/cancellations---refunds#extenuating_circumstances"><em>Meddyl's Extenuating Circumstances policy</em></a> or for any other reason. Meddyl may also determine, in its sole discretion, to refund to the Guest part or all of the amounts charged to the Guest in accordance with the <a href="https://www.Meddyl.com/terms/guest_refund_policy"><em>Guest Refund Policy</em></a>. You agree that Meddyl and the relevant Guest or Host will not have any liability for such cancellations or refunds.</p>

    <p><em>Rounding Off</em></p>

    <p>Meddyl may, in its sole discretion, round up or round down amounts that are payable from or to Guests or Hosts to the nearest whole functional base unit in which the currency is denominated (e.g. to the nearest dollar, euro or other supported currency); for example, Meddyl will round up an amount of $101.50 to $102.00, and $101.49 to $101.00.</p>

    <p>Some currencies are denominated in large numbers. In those cases, Meddyl may determine the functional base unit in which those currencies are denominated to be 10, 100 or 1,000 of the currency; the corresponding examples for such currencies would be for Meddyl to round up an amount of 1,045 up to 1,050 and 1,044 down to 1,040, or 35,450 up to 35,500 and 35,449 down to 35,400, or 837,500 up to 838,000 and 837,499 down to 837,000.</p>

    <p><em>Donations</em></p>

    <p>Some Hosts may pledge to donate a portion of the funds they receive from confirmed bookings made via the Site, Application and Services to a particular cause or charity. We do not take any responsibility or liability for whether the Host does in fact make the donation he or she pledged to make. In such cases, the Host in question is responsible for his or her own compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to such pledges and/or fund-raising.</p>

    <p><em>Booking Modifications</em></p>

    <p>You as a Guest or Host are responsible for any modifications to a booking that you direct Meddyl Customer Service to make (&quot;<strong>Booking Modifications</strong>&quot;), and you agree to pay any Accommodation Fees, Guest Fees, Hosts Fees, Services Fees, and/or Taxes associated with such Booking Modifications.</li></p>

    <p></ol></li></p>

    <p><li><strong>Taxes</strong></p>

    <p>Tax regulations may require us to collect appropriate tax information from our Hosts, or to withhold taxes from payouts to Hosts, or both. For instance, IRS regulations stipulate that we must collect an IRS Form W--9 from certain US Hosts, and an appropriate IRS Form W--8 (e.g. Form W--8BEN) from non-US hosts with at least one Listing in the US. You as a Host are solely responsible for keeping the information in your tax forms current, complete and accurate. If you as a Host fail to provide us with documentation that we determine to be sufficient to alleviate our obligation (if any) to withhold taxes from payments to you (e.g. where you are a US Host and you fail to provide us with a completed IRS Form W--9), we reserve the right in our sole discretion to freeze all payouts to you until resolution, to withhold such amounts as required by law, or to do both.</p>

    <p>You as a Host understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining (i) your applicable Tax reporting requirements, and (ii) the Taxes that should be included, and for including Taxes to be collected or obligations relating to applicable Taxes in Listings. You are also solely responsible for remitting to the relevant authority any Taxes included or received by you. Meddyl cannot and does not offer Tax-related advice to any Members.</p>

    <p>Where applicable, or based upon request from a Host, Meddyl may issue a valid VAT invoice to such Host.</p>

    <p>You understand and acknowledge that appropriate governmental agencies, departments or authorities (the &quot;<strong>Tax Authority</strong>&quot;) where your Accommodation is located may require Taxes to be collected from Guests or Hosts on the amount paid for the right to use and/or occupancy of accommodations, and to be remitted to the respective Tax Authority. The laws in jurisdictions may vary, but these taxes may be required to be collected and remitted as a percentage of the rent or Accommodation Fees set by Hosts, a set amount per day, or other variations, and are sometimes called &quot;occupancy taxes,&quot; &quot;hotel taxes,&quot; &quot;lodging taxes,&quot; &quot;transient taxes,&quot; &quot;sales and use taxes,&quot; &quot;value added taxes,&quot; &quot;room taxes&quot; or &quot;tourist taxes&quot; (hereafter, &quot;<strong>Occupancy Taxes</strong>&quot;).</p>

    <p><ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha"></p>

    <p><li><em>Occupancy Tax Collection and Remittance</em></p>

    <p>In certain jurisdictions, Meddyl may decide in its sole discretion to facilitate collection and remittance of Occupancy Taxes from or on behalf of Guests or Hosts, in accordance with your directions in these Terms (&quot;Collection and Remittance&quot;) if such tax jurisdiction asserts Meddyl or Hosts have a tax collection and remittance obligation. In any jurisdiction in which we decide to facilitate direct Collection and Remittance, whether you are a Guest or Host, in lieu of the Host collecting Occupancy taxes from Guests and remitting to the Tax Authority, you hereby instruct and authorize Meddyl (via Meddyl Payments) to collect Occupancy Taxes from Guests on the Host's behalf at the time Accommodation Fees are collected, and to remit such Occupancy Taxes to the Tax Authority. When Meddyl facilitates Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes in a jurisdiction for the first time, Meddyl will provide notice to existing Hosts with Listings for Accommodations in such jurisdictions. When a new Listing is created in a jurisdiction where Meddyl facilitates Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes, the Host will be notified in the Listing creation flow.</p>

    <p>The amount of Occupancy Taxes, if any, collected and remitted by Meddyl will be visible to and separately stated to both Guests and Hosts on their respective transaction documents. Where Meddyl is directly facilitating Collection and Remittance, Guests and Hosts agree that Hosts are not permitted to attempt collection, or collect any Occupancy Taxes relating to their Accommodations on Meddyl in that such jurisdiction. You expressly agree to release, defend, indemnify, and hold Meddyl and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, debts, obligations, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and/or accounting fees, arising out of or in any way related to Occupancy Taxes, including, without limitation, the applicability of, calculation, collection or remittance of Occupancy Taxes in any amount or at all as to your transactions or Accommodations. For any jurisdiction in which we facilitate Collection and Remittance, Hosts and Guests expressly grant us permission, without further notice, to store, transfer and disclose data and other information relating to them or to their transactions, bookings, Accommodations and Occupancy Taxes, including, but not limited to, personally identifiable information such as Host or Guest's name, Listing addresses, transaction dates and amounts, tax identification number(s), the amount of taxes collected from Guests or allegedly due, contact information and similar information, to the relevant Tax Authority.</li></p>

    <p><li><em>Opt-in to Host Remittance of Taxes</em></p>

    <p>In other jurisdictions, Meddyl may decide in its sole discretion to facilitate Occupancy Tax collection on behalf of Hosts and Guests in accordance with a Host's direction to opt in to a specific Occupancy Tax line item in the booking process, in which the Host directs that Occupancy Taxes from Guests be sent directly to the Host so that the Host will remit such taxes directly to Tax Authority (&quot;Opt-in for Host Remittance&quot;). In any jurisdiction in which we decide to facilitate Collection by Opt-in for Host Remittance, whether you are a Guest or Host, you hereby instruct and authorize Meddyl (via Meddyl Payments) to send Occupancy Taxes received from Guests at the time Accommodation Fees are collected to the Host who is obligated to send such taxes to the Tax Authority directly. If Meddyl offers and a Host selects Opt-in for Host Remittance in any jurisdiction, Hosts and Guests remain solely responsible and liable for the payment and remittance of any and all taxes that may apply to Accommodations; you agree and understand that Meddyl is not responsible for, and will not send any such Occupancy Taxes to the Tax Authority under Opt-in to Host Remittance of Taxes. You hereby agree that through third party payment processors, Meddyl is merely processing Your election and direction to have Occupancy Taxes from Guests sent directly to the Host for remittance by the Host to the Tax Authority, and that You will remit all amounts collected from Guests as Occupancy Taxes to such Tax Authority. You expressly agree to release, defend, indemnify, and hold Meddyl and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, debts, obligations, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and/or accounting fees, arising out of or in any way related to Occupancy Taxes, including, without limitation, the applicability of, calculation of, collection of Occupancy Taxes in any amount or at all as to your transactions or Accommodations. For any jurisdiction in which we facilitate Opt-in for Host Remittance, Hosts and Guests expressly grant us permission, without further notice, to store, transfer and disclose data and other information relating to them or to their transactions, bookings, Accommodations and Occupancy Taxes, including, but not limited to, personally identifiable information such as Host or Guest's name, Listing addresses, transaction dates and amounts, tax identification number(s), the amount of taxes received by Hosts from Guests, or allegedly due, contact information and similar information, to the relevant Tax Authority.</li></p>

    <p><li><em>Miscellaneous Occupancy Tax Provisions</em></p>

    <p>Whether you are a Guest or Host, you agree that any claim or cause of action relating to Meddyl's facilitation of Opt-in for Host Remittance or Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes shall not extend to any supplier or vendor that may be used by Meddyl in connection with facilitation of Opt-in Remittance or Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes, if any. Guests and Hosts agree that we may seek additional amounts from You in the event that the Taxes collected and/or remitted are insufficient to fully discharge your obligations to the Tax Authority, and agree that your sole remedy for Occupancy Taxes collected is a refund of Occupancy Taxes collected by Meddyl from the applicable Tax Authority in accordance with applicable procedures set by that Tax Authority.</p>

    <p>In any jurisdiction in which we have not provided notice of, or are not facilitating (or are no longer facilitating) the collection or remittance of Occupancy Taxes by Collection and Remittance, Opt-in for Host Remittance or any other means or method, in your jurisdiction, Hosts and Guests remain solely responsible and liable for the collection and/or remittance of any and all Occupancy Taxes that may apply to Accommodations.</p>

    <p>Hosts and Guests acknowledge and agree that in some jurisdictions, Meddyl may decide not to facilitate collection or remittance of Occupancy Taxes or may not be able to facilitate the collection and/or remittance of Occupancy Taxes, and nothing contained in these Terms of Service is a representation or guarantee that Meddyl will facilitate collection and/or remittance of Occupancy Tax anywhere at all, including in any specific jurisdiction, or that Meddyl will continue to facilitate any collection or remittance of Occupancy Tax in any specific jurisdiction in which it may have been offered. Meddyl reserves the right, in its sole determination, to cease any facilitation of any collection and remittance of Occupancy Tax (regardless of method used or to be used in the future) for any reason or no reason at all, provided that it will give Hosts reasonable notice in any jurisdiction in which Meddyl determines to cease any such facilitation.</li></p>

    <p></ol></li></p>

    <p><li><strong>Foreign Currency</strong></p>

    <p>Meddyl's online platform facilitates bookings between Guests and Hosts who may prefer to pay in a currency different from their destination currency, which may require foreign currency conversions to accommodate these differing currency preferences. Although the Meddyl platform allows users to view the price of Listings in a number of currencies, the currencies available for users to make and receive payments may be limited, and may not include the default currency in any given geographic location.</p>

    <p>Details regarding currency conversion, including any associated fees, are detailed in the <a href="http://www.Meddyl.com/terms/payments_terms"><em>Payments Terms</em></a>.</li></p>

    <p><li><strong>Damage to Accommodations and Security Deposits</strong></p>

    <p>As a Guest, you are responsible for leaving the Accommodation in the condition it was in when you arrived. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Guest, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals whom you invite to, or otherwise provide access to, the Accommodation. In the event that a Host claims otherwise and provides evidence of damage (&quot;<strong>Damage Claim</strong>&quot;), including but not limited to photographs, you agree to pay the cost of replacing the damaged items with equivalent items.</p>

    <p>Hosts may choose to include security deposits in their Listings (&quot;<strong>Security Deposits</strong>&quot;). Each Listing will describe whether a Security Deposit is required for the applicable Accommodation. Meddyl will use commercially reasonable efforts to address Hosts' requests and claims related to Security Deposits, but Meddyl is not responsible for administering or accepting any Damage Claims by Hosts related to Security Deposits, and disclaims any and all liability in this regard.</p>

    <p>If a Host makes a Damage Claim for a confirmed booking of an Accommodation, you as a Guest will be notified of any Damage Claim and given forty eight (48) hours to respond. Thereafter, Meddyl (via Meddyl Payments) will collect any such costs from you and/or against the Security Deposit in accordance with the <a href="http://www.Meddyl.com/terms/payments_terms"><em>Payments Terms</em></a>. Meddyl also reserves the right to otherwise collect payment from you and pursue any avenues available to Meddyl in this regard in situations in which you have been determined, in Meddyl's sole discretion, to have damaged any Accommodation, including, but not limited to, in relation to any payment requests made by Hosts under the Meddyl Host Guarantee, and in relation to any payments made by Meddyl (or Meddyl Payments) to Hosts.</p>

    <p>Both Guests and Hosts agree to cooperate with and assist Meddyl in good faith, and to provide Meddyl with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Meddyl, in connection with any Damage Claims or other complaints or claims made by Members relating to Accommodations or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation (including, without limitation, payment requests made under the Meddyl Host Guarantee) or with respect to any investigation undertaken by Meddyl or a representative of Meddyl regarding use or abuse of the Site, Application or the Services. If you are a Guest, upon Meddyl's reasonable request, and to the extent you are reasonably able to do so, you agree to participate in mediation or similar resolution process with a Host, at no cost to you, which process will be conducted by Meddyl or a third party selected by Meddyl or its insurer, with respect to losses for which the Host is requesting payment from Meddyl under the Meddyl Host Guarantee.</p>

    <p>If you are a Guest, you understand and agree that Meddyl may make a claim under your homeowner's, renter's or other insurance policy related to any damage or loss that you may have caused or been responsible for or to an Accommodation or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation (including without limitation amounts paid by Meddyl under the Meddyl Host Guarantee). You agree to cooperate with and assist Meddyl in good faith, and to provide Meddyl with such information as may be reasonably requested by Meddyl, in order to make a claim under your homeowner's, renter's or other insurance policy, including, but not limited to, executing documents and taking such further acts as Meddyl may reasonably request to assist Meddyl in accomplishing the foregoing</p>

    <p>Security Deposits, if required by a Host, may be applied to any fees due from a Guest overstaying at a Listing without the Host's consent.</li></p>

    <p><li><strong>Overstaying without the Host's Consent</strong></p>

    <p>Guests agree that a confirmed booking is merely a license granted by the Host to the Guest to enter and use the Listing for the limited duration of the confirmed booking and in accordance with the Guest's agreement with the Host. Guests further agree to leave the Accommodation no later than the checkout time that the Host specifies in the Listing or such other time as mutually agreed upon between the Host and Guest. If a Guest stays past the agreed upon checkout time without the Host's consent, they no longer have a license to stay in the Listing and the Host is entitled to make the Guest leave. In addition, Guests agree that the Host can charge the Guest, for each 24 hour period that the Guest stays over the agreed period without the Host's consent, an additional nightly fee of two times the average nightly Accommodation Fee originally paid by the Guest to cover the inconvenience suffered by the Host, plus all applicable Service Fees, Taxes, and any legal expenses incurred by the Host to make the Guest leave (collectively, &quot;<strong>Additional Sums</strong>&quot;). Meddyl Payments will collect Additional Sums from Guests pursuant to the <a href="http://www.Meddyl.com/terms/payments_terms"><em>Payments Terms</em></a>.</li></p>

    <p><li><strong>Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</strong></p>

    <p>These Terms and your use of the Services will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions. You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in San Francisco County, San Francisco, California or a United States District Court, Northern District of California located in San Francisco, California for any actions for which the parties <strong>retain the right to seek</strong> injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights, <strong>as set forth in the Dispute Resolution provision below.</strong></li></p>

    <p><li><strong>Dispute Resolution</strong></p>

    <p>If you reside in the United States, you and Meddyl agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the Services or use of the Site, Application or Collective Content (collectively, &quot;<strong>Disputes</strong>&quot;) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and Meddyl are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general action, or any other representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Meddyl otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this &quot;Dispute Resolution&quot; section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this &quot;Dispute Resolution&quot; section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>

    <p><em>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law</em>. This agreement to arbitrate evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;<strong>AAA</strong>&quot;) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the &quot;<strong>AAA Rules</strong>&quot;) then in effect, except as modified by this &quot;Dispute Resolution&quot; section. (The AAA Rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org/arb_med"><em>www.adr.org/arb_med</em></a> or by calling the AAA at 1--800--778--7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.</p>

    <p><em>Arbitration Process</em>. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a <a href="http://www.adr.org/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dDocName=ADRSTAGE2034889&amp;RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased"><em>form Demand for Arbitration</em></a>.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>

    <p><em>Arbitration Location and Procedure</em>. Unless you and Meddyl otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Meddyl submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>

    <p><em>Arbitrator's Decision</em>. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's award damages must be consistent with the terms of the &quot;Limitation of Liability&quot; section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Meddyl will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>

    <p><em>Fees</em>. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Meddyl will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>

    <p><em>Changes</em>. Notwithstanding the provisions of the &quot;Modification&quot; section above, if Meddyl changes this &quot;Dispute Resolution&quot; section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the &quot;Last Updated&quot; date above or in the date of Meddyl's email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Meddyl in accordance with the provisions of this &quot;Dispute Resolution&quot; section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</li></p>

    <p><li><strong>General</strong></p>

    <p>The failure of Meddyl to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Meddyl. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</li></p>

    <p><li><strong>Third party beneficiary</strong></p>

    <p>These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties.</li></p>

    <p><li><strong>Additional Clauses for Users Contracting with Meddyl Ireland</strong></p>

    <p><b>How the Site, Application and Services Work</b></p>

    <p><b>Account Registration</b></p>

    <p>In order to access certain features of the Site and Application, and to book an Accommodation or create a Listing, you must register to create an account ("<b>Meddyl Account</b>") and become a Member. You may register to join the Services directly via the Site or Application or as described in this section.</p>

    <p>You can also register to join by logging into your account with certain third-party social networking sites ("<b>SNS</b>") (including, but not limited to, Facebook; each such account, a "<b>Third-Party Account</b>"), via our Site or Application, as described below. As part of the functionality of the Site, Application and Services, you may link your Meddyl Account with Third-Party Accounts, by either: (i) providing your Third-Party Account login information to Meddyl through the Site, Services or Application; or (ii) allowing Meddyl to access your Third-Party Account, as permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third-Party Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third-Party Account login information to Meddyl and/or grant Meddyl access to your Third-Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein), without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third-Party Account and without obligating Meddyl to pay any fees or making Meddyl subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third-party service providers. By granting Meddyl access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand that Meddyl will access, make available and store (if applicable) any Content that you have provided to and stored in your Third-Party Account ("<b>SNS Content</b>") so that it is available on and through the Site, Services and Application via your Meddyl Account and Meddyl Account profile page. Unless otherwise specified in these Terms, all SNS Content, if any, will be considered to be Member Content for all purposes of these Terms. Depending on the Third-Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third-Party Accounts will be available on and through your Meddyl Account on the Site, Services and Application. Please note that if a Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or Meddyl's access to such Third-Party Account is terminated by the third-party service provider, then SNS Content will no longer be available on and through the Site, Services and Application. You have the ability to disable the connection between your Meddyl Account and your Third-Party Accounts, at any time, by accessing the "Settings" section of the Site and Application. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. Meddyl makes no effort to review any SNS Content for any purpose, including but not limited to for accuracy, legality or non-infringement and Meddyl is not responsible for any SNS Content.</p>

    <p>Your Meddyl Account and your Meddyl Account profile page will be created for your use of the Site and Application based upon the personal information you provide to us or that we obtain via an SNS as described above. You may not have more than one (1) active Meddyl Account. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. Meddyl reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Meddyl Account and your access to the Site, Application and Services if you create more than one (1) Meddyl Account, or if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, fraudulent, not current or incomplete. You are responsible for safeguarding your password. You agree that you will not disclose your password to any third party and that you will take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your Meddyl Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify Meddyl of any unauthorized use of your Meddyl Account.</p>

    <p><b>Accommodation Listings</b></p>

    <p>As a Member, you may create Listings. To create a Listing, you will be asked a variety of questions about the Accommodation to be listed, including, but not limited to, the location, capacity, size, features, and availability of the Accommodation and pricing and related rules and financial terms. In order to be featured in Listings via the Site, Application and Services, all Accommodations must have valid physical addresses. Listings will be made publicly available via the Site, Application and Services. Other Members will be able to book your Accommodation via the Site, Application and Services based upon the information provided in your Listing. You understand and agree that once a Guest requests a booking of your Accommodation, you may not request the Guest to pay a higher price than in the booking request.</p>

    <p>You acknowledge and agree that you alone are responsible for any and all Listings and Member Content you post. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the booking of, or a Guest's stay at, an Accommodation in a Listing you post (i) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties, such as homeowners association, condominium, lease or rental agreements, and (ii) will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws (such as zoning laws and laws governing rentals of residential and other properties), Tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to any Accommodation included in a Listing you post (including having all required permits, licenses and registrations), and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties. Please note that Meddyl assumes no responsibility for a Host's compliance with any agreements with or duties to third parties, applicable laws, rules and regulations. Meddyl reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Listing for any reason, including Listings that Meddyl, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or Meddyl's then-current <a href="http://www.Meddyl.com/help/policies">Policies and Community Guidelines</a>, or otherwise harmful to the Site, Application or Services.</p>

    <p>If you are a Host, you understand and agree that Meddyl does not act as an insurer or as your contracting agent. If a Guest requests a booking of your Accommodation and stays at your Accommodation, any agreement you enter into with such Guest is between you and the Guest and Meddyl is not a party to it. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Meddyl Payments serves as the limited authorized payment collection agent of the Host for the purpose of accepting, on behalf of the Host, payments from Guests of such amounts stipulated by the Host (including cleaning or other fees and/or Taxes).</p>

    <p>When you create a Listing, you may also choose to include certain requirements which must be met by the Members who are eligible to request a booking of your Accommodation, such as requiring Members to have a profile picture or verified phone number, in order to book your Accommodation. Any Member wishing to book Accommodations included in Listings with such requirements must meet these requirements. More information on how to set such requirements is available via the "Hosting" section of the Site, Application and Services.</p>

    <p>If you are a Host, Meddyl makes certain tools available to you to help you to make informed decisions about which Members you choose to confirm or preapprove for booking for your Accommodation. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Host, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who reside at or are otherwise present at the Accommodation at your request or invitation, excluding the Guest (and the individuals the Guest invites to the Accommodation, if applicable.)</p>

    <p>Meddyl recommends that Hosts obtain appropriate insurance for their Accommodations. Please review any insurance policy that you may have for your Accommodation carefully, and in particular please make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of Guests (and the individuals the Guest invites to the Accommodation, if applicable) while at your Accommodation.</p>

    <p>Meddyl may offer Hosts the option of having photographers take photographs of their Accommodations. If you as a Host choose to have a photographer do this, the photographs taken will be made available to you to include in your Listing with a watermark or tag bearing the words "Meddyl.com Verified Photo" or similar wording ("<b>Verified Images</b>"). You agree that you alone are responsible for ensuring that your Listing is accurately represented in the Verified Images. You alone are responsible for using the Verified Images and you warrant that you will cease to use the Verified Images or any other images if such images cease to accurately represent your Listing. All images, materials and content created by these photographers, including Verified Images, constitute Meddyl Content, regardless of whether you include them in your Listing. You agree that Meddyl may use the Verified Images for advertising, marketing, commercial and other business purposes in any media or platform, whether in relation to your Listing or otherwise, without further notice or compensation.</p>

    <p><b>No Endorsement</b></p>

    <p>Meddyl does not endorse any Member or any Accommodation. You understand that Verified Images are intended only to indicate a photographic representation of the Accommodation at the time the photograph was taken. Verified Images are therefore not an endorsement by Meddyl of any Member or any Accommodation. Members are required by these Terms to provide accurate information, and although Meddyl may undertake additional checks and processes designed to help verify or check the identities or backgrounds of users, we do not make any representations about, confirm, or endorse any Member or the Member's purported identity or background.</p>

    <p>Any references in the Site, Application or Services to a Member being "verified" or "connected" (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification process, and does not represent anything else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by Meddyl about any Member, including of the Member's identity and whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. Instead, any such description is intended to be useful information for you to evaluate when you make your own decisions about the identity and suitability of others whom you contact or interact with via the Site, Application and Services. We therefore recommend that you always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to stay with a Host or to accept a booking request from a Guest, or to have any other interaction with any other Member. Except as provided in the Meddyl <a href="http://www.Meddyl.com/terms/host_guarantee">Host Guarantee Terms and Conditions</a> ("<b>Meddyl Host Guarantee</b>"), which is an agreement between Meddyl and Hosts, we are not responsible for any damage or harm resulting from your interactions with other Members.</p>

    <p>By using the Site, Application or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Members or other third parties who caused you harm. You agree not to attempt to impose liability on or seek any legal remedy from Meddyl with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly with other Members on the Site and Services regarding any bookings or Listings made by you. This limitation shall not apply to any claim by a Host against Meddyl regarding the remittance of payments received from a Guest by Meddyl on behalf of a Host, which instead shall be subject to the limitations described in the section below entitled "Limitation of Liability".</p>

    <p><b>Bookings and Financial Terms</b></p>

    <p><i>Key definitions</i></p>

    <p>
        "<b>Accommodation Fees</b>" means the amounts that are due and payable by a Guest in exchange for that Guest's stay in an Accommodation. The Host alone, and not Meddyl, is responsible for the Accommodation Fees for his or her Listing. The Host may in his or her sole discretion decide to include in these amounts (i) a cleaning fee or any other fee permitted on the Meddyl platform, or (ii) Taxes that the Host determines that he or she has to collect.
        <br />"<b>Guest Fees</b>" means the fee that Meddyl charges a Guest for the use of the Services, which is calculated as a percentage of the applicable Accommodation Fees. The Guest Fees will be displayed to the Guest when the Guest is asked whether to send a booking request to a Host.
        <br />"<b>Host Fees</b>" means the fee that Meddyl charges a Host for the use of the Services, which is calculated as a percentage of the applicable Accommodation Fees. The Host Fees will be displayed to the Host when the Host is asked whether to confirm or reject a booking request from a prospective Guest.
        <br />"<b>Service Fees</b>" means collectively the Guest Fees and the Host Fees.
        <br />"<b>Total Fees</b>" means collectively the Accommodation Fees and the Guest Fees plus any Taxes.
    </p>

    <p><i>Bookings and Financial Terms for Hosts and Guests</i></p>

    <p>If you are a Host and a booking is requested for your Accommodation via the Site, Application or Services, you will be required to either confirm or reject the booking request within the Booking Request Period, otherwise the booking request will automatically expire. When a booking is requested via the Site, Application or Services, we will share with you (i) the first and last name of the Guest who has requested the booking, (ii) a link to the Guest's Meddyl Account profile page, (iii) if the Guest and Host have both connected their Meddyl accounts to SNS, the names of any members of an SNS with whom you are "friends" or associated on the SNS if such individuals are also "friends" or associated with the Guest on such SNS, and (iv) an indication of whether or not the Guest has provided other information to Meddyl, such as a verified email address, connection to SNSs, or a government ID. If you are unable to confirm or decide to reject a booking request within the Booking Request Period, any amounts collected by Meddyl for the requested booking will be refunded to the applicable Guest's credit card and any pre-authorization of such credit card will be released. When you confirm a booking requested by a Guest, Meddyl will send you an email, text message or message via the Application confirming such booking, depending on the selections you make via the Site, Application and Services.</p>

    <p>Meddyl Payments will collect the Total Fees at the time of booking confirmation (i.e. when the Host confirms the booking request) and will initiate payment of the Accommodation Fees (less Meddyl's Host Fees and any Taxes in respect of the Host Fees, such as VAT in Europe) to the Host within 24 hours of when the Guest arrives at the applicable Accommodation (except to the extent that a refund is due to the Guest). The time it takes for the Host to receive payouts may depend upon the payout method chosen by the Host. Some methods involve the use of third-party payment processors, who may impose their own additional charges for the use of their services on the Host, including by deducting their charges from the payout amount.</p>

    <p>If you owe or agree to pay any amount via Meddyl Payments to Meddyl (whether as a result of your bookings or actions as a Guest or otherwise), then Meddyl Payments may (but is not obliged to) withhold the amount owing to Meddyl from any payout amounts due to you as a Host, and use the withheld amount to setoff the amount owed by you to Meddyl. If Meddyl Payments does so, then your obligation to pay Meddyl will be extinguished to the extent of the amount withheld by Meddyl Payments, and Meddyl will cease to owe to you any obligations (including, but not limited to, any obligation to pay you) with respect to the amount withheld. In addition to the amount due, if your account is delinquent or you otherwise have chargebacks on your account, you may be charged fees that are incidental to our collection of these delinquent amounts and chargebacks. Such fees or charges may include collection fees, convenience fees, or other third party charges. You hereby explicitly agree that all communication in relation to delinquent accounts will be made by electronic mail or by phone, as provided to Meddyl by you. Such communication may be made by Meddyl or by anyone on its behalf, including but not limited to a third party collection agent.</p>

    <p><i>Appointment of Meddyl Payments as Limited Payment Collection Agent for Host</i></p>

    <p>Each Host hereby appoints Meddyl Payments as the Host's limited payment collection agent solely for the purpose of accepting the Accommodation Fees from Guests.</p>

    <p>Each Host agrees that payment made by a Guest through Meddyl Payments, shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Host, and the Host will make the Accommodation available to the Guest in the agreed-upon manner as if the Host has received the Accommodation Fees. Each Host agrees that Meddyl may, in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Host and reflected in the relevant Listing, (i) permit the Guest to cancel the booking and (ii) refund (via Meddyl Payments) to the Guest that portion of the Accommodation Fees specified in the applicable cancellation policy. Each Host understands that as Meddyl Payments accepts payments from Guests as the Host's limited payment collection agent and that Meddyl Payments' obligation to pay the Host is subject to and conditional upon successful receipt of the associated payments from Guests. Meddyl does not guarantee payments to Hosts for amounts that have not been successfully received by Meddyl Payments from Guests. In accepting appointment as the limited authorized agent of the Host, Meddyl Payments assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Host.</p>

    <p>Please note that Meddyl does not currently charge fees for the creation of Listings. However, you as a Host acknowledge and agree that Meddyl reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to charge you for and collect fees from you for the creation of Listings. Please note that Meddyl will provide notice of any Listing fee collection via the Site, Application and Services, prior to implementing such a Listing fee feature.</p>

    <p><i>Bookings and Financial Terms for Guests</i></p>

    <p>The Hosts, not Meddyl, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed bookings and making available any Accommodations reserved through the Site, Application and Services. If you, as a Guest, choose to enter into a transaction with a Host for the booking of an Accommodation, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the Host and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Accommodation imposed by the Host. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Meddyl, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, that Meddyl is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its payment obligations hereunder, Meddyl disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements. You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the fact that Meddyl is not a party to the agreement between you and the Host, Meddyl Payments acts as the Host's payment collection agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the Host. Upon your payment of the Total Fees to Meddyl Payments, your payment obligation to the Host for the Accommodation Fees is extinguished, and Meddyl Payments is responsible for remitting the Accommodation Fees (less the Host Fees and any Taxes in respect of the Host Fees, such as VAT in Europe), in the manner described in these Terms. In the event that Meddyl Payments does not remit any such amounts as described in these Terms, such Host will have recourse only against such Meddyl entity.</p>

    <p>The Total Fees payable will be displayed to a Guest before the Guest sends a booking request to a Host. As noted above, the Host is required to either confirm or reject the booking request within the Booking Request Period; otherwise, the requested booking will be automatically cancelled. If a requested booking is cancelled (i.e. not confirmed by the applicable Host), any amounts collected by Meddyl Payments will be refunded to such Guest, depending on the selections the Guest makes via the Site and Application, and any pre-authorization of such Guest's credit card will be released, if applicable.</p>

    <p>You as a Guest agree to pay Meddyl for the Total Fees for any booking requested in connection with your Meddyl Account if such requested bookings are confirmed by the applicable Host. In order to establish a booking pending the applicable Host's confirmation of your requested booking, you understand and agree that Meddyl Payments, on behalf of the Host, reserve the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorization via your credit card for the Total Fees or (ii) charge your credit card a nominal amount, not to exceed one dollar ($1), or a similar sum in the currency in which you are transacting (e.g. one euro or one British pound), to verify your credit card. As a general rule, Meddyl Payments will collect the Total Fees due once Meddyl receives confirmation of your booking from the applicable Host; if necessary, Total Fees may instead be collected at a later point. Please note that Meddyl cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Guest by his or her bank related to Meddyl's collection of the Total Fees, and Meddyl disclaims all liability in this regard.</p>

    <p>In connection with your requested booking, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to Meddyl Payments or its third-party payment processor(s). You agree to pay Meddyl Payments for any confirmed bookings made in connection with your Meddyl Account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods described on the Site or Application, e.g. by PayPal or credit card. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the booking, either directly by Meddyl Payments or indirectly, via a third-party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Site or Application. You also authorize Meddyl Payments to charge your credit card in the event of damage caused at an Accommodation as contemplated under "Damage to Accommodations" below and for Security Deposits, if applicable. If you are directed to Meddyl Payments' third-party payment processor(s), you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party's service and that third party's personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services. Once your confirmed booking transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed booking.</p>

    <p><b>Security Deposits</b></p>

    <p>Hosts may choose to include security deposits in their Listings ("<b>Security Deposits</b>"). Each Listing will describe whether a Security Deposit is required for the applicable Accommodation. If a Security Deposit is included in a Listing for a confirmed booking of an Accommodation, and a Host makes a claim against such Security Deposit, Meddyl Payments will, in its capacity as the payment collection agent of the Host, use its commercially reasonable efforts to charge the Guest's payment method in the amount of the Security Deposit, within a reasonable period of time after the Guest's check-out from the Host's Accommodation. Meddyl will also use its commercially reasonable efforts to address Hosts' requests and claims related to Security Deposits, but Meddyl is not responsible for administering or accepting any claims by Hosts related to Security Deposits, and disclaims any and all liability in this regard.</p>

    <p><b>Service Fees</b></p>

    <p>In consideration for the use of Meddyl's online marketplace and platform, Meddyl charges the Service Fees. Where applicable, Taxes (such as VAT in Europe) may also be charged in respect of the Host Fees and Guest Fees. Meddyl Payments deducts the Host Fees from the Accommodation Fees before remitting the balance to the Host as described in these Terms. Guest Fees are, as noted above, included in the Total Fees.</p>

    <p>Balances will be remitted by Meddyl Payments to Hosts via check, PayPal, direct deposit or other payment methods, as described on the Site or via the Application, in the Host's currency of choice, depending upon the selections the Host makes via the Site, Application and Services. Amounts may be rounded up or down as described the "Rounding Off" section below.</p>

    <p>Please note that Meddyl Payments, may impose or deduct foreign currency processing costs on or from any payments or payouts by Meddyl in currencies other than U.S. dollars. More information on any such costs or deductions will be available via the Site and Application. More information on Services Fees can be found at <a href="http://www.Meddyl.com/help" target="_blank">www.Meddyl.com/help</a>. Except as otherwise provided herein, Service Fees are non-refundable.</p>

    <p><b>General Booking and Financial Terms</b></p>

    <p><i>Cancellations and Refunds</i></p>

    <p>If, as a Guest, you cancel your requested booking before the requested booking is confirmed by a Host, Meddyl Payments will cancel any pre-authorization to your credit card and/or refund any nominal amounts charged to your credit card in connection with the requested booking within a commercially reasonable time. If, as a Guest, you wish to cancel a confirmed booking made via the Site, Application and Services, either prior to or after arriving at the Accommodation, the cancellation policy of the Host contained in the applicable Listing will apply to such cancellation. Our ability to refund the Accommodation Fees and other amounts charged to you will depend upon the terms of the applicable cancellation policy. Details regarding refunds and cancellation policies are available via the Site and Application. The Guest Fee is non-refundable regardless of the cancellation policy selected by the Host.</p>

    <p>If a Host cancels a confirmed booking made via the Site, Services, and Application, (i) Meddyl Payments will refund the Total Fees for such booking to the applicable Guest within a commercially reasonable time of the cancellation and (ii) the Guest will receive an email or other communication from Meddyl containing alternative Listings and other related information. If the Guest requests a booking from one of the alternative Listings and the Host associated with such alternative Listing confirms the Guest's requested booking, then the Guest agrees to pay Meddyl the Total Fees relating to the confirmed booking for the Accommodation in the alternative Listing, in accordance with these Terms. If a Host cancelled a confirmed booking and you, as a Guest, have not received an email or other communication from Meddyl, please <a href="http://www.Meddyl.com/help/contact_us">contact Meddyl</a>.</p>

    <p>If, as a Host, you cancel a confirmed booking, you agree that Meddyl may apply penalties or consequences to you or your Listing, including (i) publishing an automated review on your Listing indicating that a reservation was cancelled, (ii) keeping the calendar for your Listing unavailable or blocked for the dates of the cancelled booking, or (iii) imposing a cancellation fee (to be withheld from your future payouts or charged to the credit card on file in your Meddyl Account). You will be notified of the situations in which a cancellation fee applies before you decide to cancel.</p>

    <p>In certain circumstances, Meddyl may decide, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary or desirable to cancel a confirmed booking made via the Site, Application and Services. This may be for reasons set forth in <a href="http://www.Meddyl.com/help/policies/cancellations_and_refunds#extenuating_circumstanceswww.Meddyl.com/help/policies/cancellations_and_refunds">Meddyl's Extenuating Circumstances policy</a> or for any other reason. Meddyl Payments may also determine, in its sole discretion, to refund to the Guest part or all of the amounts charged to the Guest in accordance with the <a href="http://www.Meddyl.com/terms/guest_refund_policy">Guest Refund Policy</a>. You agree that Meddyl and the relevant Guest or Host will not have any liability for such cancellations or refunds.</p>

    <p>If, as a Host, your Guest cancels a confirmed booking or Meddyl decides that it is necessary to cancel a confirmed booking, and Meddyl issues a refund to the Guest in accordance with the Guest Refund Policy or other applicable cancellation policies, you agree that in the event you have already been paid Meddyl shall be entitled to recover the amount of any such Guest refund from you, including by subtracting such refund amount out from any future Accommodation Fees due to you.</p>

    <p><i>Recurring Payments</i></p>

    <p>In some instances, Guests may be required to make recurring, incremental payments toward the Total Fees owed for a confirmed booking before beginning his or her stay at the applicable Accommodation (collectively, "<b>Recurring Payments</b>"). More information on Recurring Payments will be made available via the Site, Application and Services, if applicable. If Recurring Payments apply to a confirmed booking, then the Guest authorizes Meddyl Payments, on behalf of the Host, to collect the Total Fees and the Host agrees that such Meddyl entity will initiate payouts to the Host, in the increments and at the frequency associated with the applicable Recurring Payments, each as identified on the Site, Application and Services.</p>

    <p><i>Rounding Off</i></p>

    <p>Meddyl may, in its sole discretion, round up or round down amounts that are payable from or to Guests or Hosts to the nearest whole functional base unit in which the currency is denominated (e.g. to the nearest dollar, euro or other supported currency); for example, Meddyl will round up an amount of $101.50 to $102.00, and $101.49 to $101.00.</p>

    <p>Some currencies are denominated in large numbers. In those cases, Meddyl may determine the functional base unit in which those currencies are denominated to be 10, 100 or 1,000 of the currency; the corresponding examples for such currencies would be for Meddyl to round up an amount of 1,045 up to 1,050 and 1,044 down to 1,040, or 35,450 up to 35,500 and 35,449 down to 35,400, or 837,500 up to 838,000 and 837,499 down to 837,000.</p>

    <p><i>Payment Processing Errors</i></p>

    <p>We will take steps to rectify any payment processing errors that we become aware of. These steps may include crediting or debiting (as appropriate) the same payment method used for the original payout to or payment by you, so that you end up receiving or paying the correct amount. </p>

    <p><i>Donations</i></p>

    <p>Some Hosts may pledge to donate a portion of the funds they receive from confirmed bookings made via the Site, Application and Services to a particular cause or charity. We do not take any responsibility or liability for whether the Host does in fact make the donation he or she pledged to make. In such cases, the Host in question is responsible for his or her own compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to such pledges and/or fund-raising.</p>

    <p><b>Taxes</b></p>

    <p>Tax regulations may require us to collect appropriate tax information from our Hosts, or to withhold taxes from payouts to Hosts, or both. For instance, IRS regulations stipulate that we must collect an IRS Form W-9 from our US Hosts, and an appropriate IRS Form W-8 (e.g. Form W-8BEN) from non-US hosts with at least one Listing in the US. You as a Host are solely responsible for keeping the information in your tax forms current, complete and accurate. If you as a Host fail to provide us with documentation that we determine to be sufficient to alleviate our obligation (if any) to withhold taxes from payments to you (e.g. where you are a US Host and you fail to provide us with a completed IRS Form W-9), we reserve the right in our sole discretion to freeze all payouts to you until resolution, to withhold such amounts as required by law, or to do both.</p>

    <p>You as a Host understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining (i) your applicable Tax reporting requirements, and (ii) the Taxes that should be included, and for including Taxes to be collected or obligations relating to applicable Taxes in Listings. You are also solely responsible for remitting to the relevant authority any Taxes included or received by you. Meddyl cannot and does not offer Tax-related advice to any Members.</p>

    <p>Where applicable, or based upon request from a Host, Meddyl may issue a valid VAT invoice to such Host.</p>

    <p>You understand and acknowledge that appropriate governmental agencies, departments or authorities (the "<b>Tax Authority</b>") where your Accommodation is located may require Taxes to be collected from Guests or Hosts on the amount paid for the right to use and/or occupancy of accommodations, and to be remitted to the respective Tax Authority. The laws in jurisdictions may vary, but these taxes may be required to be collected and remitted as a percentage of the rent or Accommodation Fees set by Hosts, a set amount per day, or other variations, and are sometimes called "occupancy taxes," "hotel taxes," "lodging taxes," "transient taxes," "sales and use taxes," "value added taxes," "room taxes" or "tourist taxes" (hereafter, "<b>Occupancy Taxes</b>").</p>

    <p><i>Occupancy Tax Collection and Remittance</i></p>

    <p>In certain jurisdictions, Meddyl may decide in its sole discretion to facilitate collection and remittance of Occupancy Taxes from or on behalf of Guests or Hosts, in accordance with your directions in this Agreement ("Collection and Remittance") if such tax jurisdiction asserts Meddyl or Hosts have a tax collection and remittance obligation. In any jurisdiction in which we decide to facilitate direct Collection and Remittance, whether you are a Guest or Host, in lieu of the Host collecting Occupancy taxes from Guests and remitting to the Tax Authority, you hereby instruct and authorize Meddyl to collect Occupancy Taxes from Guests on the Host's behalf at the time Accommodation Fees are collected, and to remit such Occupancy Taxes to the Tax Authority. When Meddyl facilitates Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes in a jurisdiction for the first time, Meddyl will provide notice to existing Hosts with Listings for Accommodations in such jurisdictions. When a new listing is created in a jurisdiction where Meddyl facilitates Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes, the Host will be notified in the listing creation flow.  </p>

    <p>The amount of Occupancy Taxes, if any, collected and remitted by Meddyl will be visible to and separately stated to both Guests and Hosts on their respective transaction documents. Where Meddyl is directly facilitating Collection and Remittance, Guests and Hosts agree that Hosts are not permitted to attempt collection, or collect any Occupancy Taxes relating to their Accommodations on Meddyl in that such jurisdiction. You expressly agree to release, defend, indemnify, and hold Meddyl and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, debts, obligations, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and/or accounting fees, arising out of or in any way related to Occupancy Taxes, including, without limitation, the applicability of, calculation, collection or remittance of Occupancy Taxes in any amount or at all as to your transactions or Accommodations.   For any jurisdiction in which we facilitate Collection and Remittance, Hosts and Guests expressly grant us permission, without further notice, to store, transfer and disclose data and other information relating to them or to their Transactions, Bookings, Accommodations and Occupancy Taxes, including, but not limited to, personally identifiable information such as Host or Guest's name, listing addresses, transaction dates and amounts, tax identification number(s), the amount of taxes collected from Guests or allegedly due, contact information and similar information, to the relevant Tax Authority.</p>

    <p><i>Opt-in to Host Remittance of Taxes</i></p>

    <p>In other jurisdictions, Meddyl may decide in its sole discretion to facilitate Occupancy Tax collection on behalf of Hosts and Guests in accordance with a Host's direction to opt in to a specific Occupancy Tax line item in the booking process, in which the Host directs that Occupancy Taxes from Guests be sent directly to the Host so that the Host will remit such taxes directly to Tax Authority -(-"Opt-in for Host Remittance"). In any jurisdiction in which we decide to facilitate Collection by Opt-in for Host Remittance, whether you are a Guest or Host, you hereby instruct and authorize Meddyl to send Occupancy Taxes received from Guests at the time Accommodation Fees are collected to the Host who is obligated to send such taxes to the Tax Authority directly. If Meddyl offers and a Host selects Opt-in for Host Remittance in any jurisdiction, Hosts and Guests remain solely responsible and liable for the payment and remittance of any and all taxes that may apply to Accommodations; you agree and understand that Meddyl is not responsible for, and will not send any such Occupancy Taxes to the Tax Authority under Opt-in to Host Remittance of Taxes.  You hereby agree that through third party payment processors, Meddyl is merely processing Your election and direction to have Occupancy Taxes from Guests sent directly to the Host for remittance by the Host to the Tax Authority, and that You will remit all amounts collected from Guests as Occupancy Taxes to such Tax Authority.  You expressly agree to release, defend, indemnify, and hold Meddyl and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, debts, obligations, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and/or accounting fees, arising out of or in any way related to Occupancy Taxes,  including, without limitation, the applicability of, calculation of, collection of Occupancy Taxes in any amount or at all as to your transactions or Accommodations.  For any jurisdiction in which we facilitate Opt-in for Host Remittance, Hosts and Guests expressly grant us permission, without further notice, to store, transfer and disclose data and other information relating to them or to their Transactions, Bookings, Accommodations and Occupancy Taxes, including, but not limited to, personally identifiable information such as Host or Guest's name, listing addresses, transaction dates and amounts, tax identification number(s), the amount of taxes received by Hosts from Guests, or allegedly due, contact information and similar information, to the relevant Tax Authority.</p>

    <p><i>Miscellaneous Occupancy Tax Provisions</i></p>

    <p>Whether you are a Guest or Host, you agree that any claim or cause of action relating to Meddyl's facilitation of Opt-in Remittance or Collection and Remittance of Taxes shall not extend to any supplier or vendor that may be used by Meddyl in connection with facilitation of Opt-in Remittance or Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes, if any. Guests and Hosts agree that we may seek additional amounts from You in the event that the Taxes collected and/or remitted are insufficient to fully discharge your obligations to the Tax Authority, and agree that your sole remedy for Occupancy Taxes collected is a refund of Occupancy Taxes collected by Meddyl from the applicable Tax Authority in accordance with applicable procedures set by that Tax Authority.</p>

    <p>In any jurisdiction in which we have not provided notice of, or are not facilitating (or are no longer facilitating) the collection or remittance of Occupancy Taxes by Collection and Remittance, Opt-in for Host Remittance or any other means or method, in your jurisdiction, Hosts and Guests remain solely responsible and liable for the collection and/or remittance of any and all Occupancy Taxes that may apply to Accommodations.</p>

    <p>Hosts and Guests acknowledge and agree that in some jurisdictions, Meddyl may decide not to facilitate collection or remittance of Occupancy Taxes or may not be able to facilitate the collection and/or remittance of Occupancy Taxes, and nothing contained in this Agreement is a representation or guarantee that Meddyl will facilitate collection and/or remittance of Occupancy Tax anywhere at all, including in any specific jurisdiction, or that Meddyl will continue to facilitate any collection or remittance of Occupancy Tax in any specific jurisdiction in which it may have been offered. Meddyl reserves the right, in its sole determination, to cease any facilitation of any collection and remittance of Occupancy Tax (regardless of method used or to be used in the future) for any reason or no reason at all, provided that it will give Hosts reasonable notice in any jurisdiction in which Meddyl determines to cease any such facilitation.  </p>

    <p><i>Damage to Accommodations</i></p>

    <p>As a Guest, you are responsible for leaving the Accommodation in the condition it was in when you arrived. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Guest, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals whom you invite to, or otherwise provide access to, the Accommodation. In the event that a Host claims otherwise and provides evidence of damage, including but not limited to photographs, you agree to pay the cost of replacing the damaged items with equivalent items. After being notified of the claim and given forty eight (48) hours to respond, the payment will be charged to and taken from the credit card on file in your Meddyl Account. Meddyl also reserves the right to charge the credit card on file in your Meddyl Account, or otherwise collect payment from you and pursue any avenues available to Meddyl in this regard, including using Security Deposits, in situations in which you have been determined, in Meddyl's sole discretion, to have damaged any Accommodation, including, but not limited to, in relation to any payment requests made by Hosts under the Meddyl Host Guarantee, and in relation to any payments made by Meddyl to Hosts. If we are unable to charge the credit card on file or otherwise collect payment from you, you agree to remit payment for any damage to the Accommodation to the applicable Host or to Meddyl (if applicable).</p>

    <p>Both Guests and Hosts agree to cooperate with and assist Meddyl in good faith, and to provide Meddyl with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Meddyl, in connection with any complaints or claims made by Members relating to Accommodations or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation (including, without limitation, payment requests made under the Meddyl Host Guarantee) or with respect to any investigation undertaken by Meddyl or a representative of Meddyl regarding use or abuse of the Site, Application or the Services. If you are a Guest, upon Meddyl's reasonable request, and to the extent you are reasonably able to do so, you agree to participate in mediation or similar resolution process with a Host, at no cost to you, which process will be conducted by Meddyl or a third party selected by Meddyl or its insurer, with respect to losses for which the Host is requesting payment from Meddyl under the Meddyl Host Guarantee.</p>

    <p>If you are a Guest, you understand and agree that Meddyl may make a claim under your homeowner's, renter's or other insurance policy related to any damage or loss that you may have caused or been responsible for or to an Accommodation or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation (including without limitation amounts paid by Meddyl under the Meddyl Host Guarantee). You agree to cooperate with and assist Meddyl in good faith, and to provide Meddyl with such information as may be reasonably requested by Meddyl, in order to make a claim under your homeowner's, renter's or other insurance policy, including, but not limited to, executing documents and taking such further acts as Meddyl may reasonably request to assist Meddyl in accomplishing the foregoing.</p>

    <p><i>Overstaying without the Host's Consent</i></p>

    <p>Guests agree that a confirmed reservation is merely a license granted by the Host to the Guest to enter and use the Listing for the limited duration of the confirmed reservation and in accordance with the Guest's agreement with the Host. Guests further agree to leave the Accommodation no later than the checkout time that the Host specifies in the Listing or such other time as mutually agreed upon between the Host and Guest. If a Guest stays past the agreed upon checkout time without the Host's consent, they no longer have a license to stay in the Listing and the Host is entitled to make the Guest leave. In addition, Guests agree that the Host can charge the Guest, for each 24 hour period that the Guest stays over the agreed period without the Host's consent, an additional nightly fee of two times the average nightly Accommodation Fee originally paid by the Guest to cover the inconvenience suffered by the Host, plus all applicable Service Fees, Taxes, and any legal expenses incurred by the Host to make the Guest leave (collectively, "Additional Sums"). Guests agree that Meddyl Payments, in its role as limited collection agent for the Host, shall charge the Guest's credit card or other payment methods it has on file to collect these Additional Sums. In addition, Meddyl Payments may recover any costs and expenses it incurs in collecting the Additional Sums by charging the Guest's credit card or other payment method on file.</p>

    <p><b>Foreign Currency</b></p>

    <p>Meddyl's online platform facilitates bookings between Guests and Hosts who may prefer to pay and to receive payments in different currencies, which may require foreign currency conversions to accommodate these differing currency preferences. Although the Meddyl platform allows users to view the price of Listings in a number of currencies, the currencies available for users to make and receive payments may be limited, and may not include the default currency in any given geographic location.</p>

    <p>Each foreign currency conversion is processed at a foreign currency conversion rate. This rate generally refers to the amount of one currency that must be paid to buy a certain amount of another currency at a given time. For example, if it costs US$125.00 to buy €100.00, the currency conversion rate of US dollars to Euros would be 1.25, and the currency conversion rate from Euros to US dollars would be 0.8. Currency conversion rates will vary from time to time.</p>

    <p><i>Key definitions</i></p>

    <p>
        "<b>Display Currency</b>" means the currency in which users view Listing prices on the Meddyl platform. Guests may choose and change the Display Currency in order to view the pricing for a Listing in a number of different supported currencies.
        <br />"<b>Booking Currency</b>" means the currency in which a Guest has to pay for his or her booking. At the time the Guest submits a booking request, the Meddyl platform will select the Booking Currency, based on the Guest's country of origin and the payment methods available for that country. Meddyl supports only a certain number of currencies as Booking Currencies. The Booking Currency for a booking may be different from the relevant Listing Currency.
        <br />"<b>Listing Currency</b>" means the currency in which a Listing's price is set. The Listing Currency is set by the Host.
        <br />"<b>Payout Currency</b>" means the currency in which a Host's payout will be paid to the Host. The Payout Currency is set by the Host.
        <br />"<b>Base Exchange Rate</b>" means a system-wide rate used by Meddyl for foreign currency conversion that is in effect at the time the foreign currency conversion is processed, and does not include any fee or mark-up by Meddyl. Meddyl establishes the Base Exchange Rate using data from one or more third parties such as OANDA (<a href="http://www.oanda.com" target="_blank">http://www.oanda.com</a>).
        <br />"<b>Adjusted Exchange Rate</b>" means a rate for foreign currency conversion that is calculated by adding a mark-up to the Base Exchange Rate. This mark-up represents a charge imposed by Meddyl for its holding costs and foreign currency risks.
    </p>

    <p><i>Foreign currency conversions on the Meddyl platform</i></p>

    <p>Meddyl Payments will process a foreign currency conversion in the following situations:</p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <br />
            <li>The Display Currency is different from the Listing Currency when a user views a Listing: Meddyl will calculate the estimated Total Fees in the Display Currency, by applying either the Base Exchange Rate or the Adjusted Exchange Rate at the time of the view to the estimated Total Fees in the Listing Currency. The Adjusted Exchange Rate will be applied if the Display Currency is a supported Booking Currency, and it is different from the Listing Currency. Otherwise, the Base Exchange Rate will be applied.</li>
            <br />
            <li>The Booking Currency is different from the Listing Currency when a Guest submits a booking request for a Listing: Meddyl will calculate the Total Fees in the Booking Currency, by applying either the Base Exchange Rate or the Adjusted Exchange Rate at the time of the booking request to the Total Fees in the Listing Currency. The Guest will be able to view the actual exchange rate applied. The Guest Fee, which is a percentage of the applicable Accommodation Fees, will be calculated based on the Accommodation Fees in the Booking Currency (i.e. after conversion from the Listing Currency). The Adjusted Exchange Rate will be applied if the Display Currency is the same as the Booking Currency, and it is different from the Listing Currency for the Listing. Otherwise, the Base Exchange Rate will be applied.</li>
            <br />
            <li>The Payout Currency is different from the Listing Currency when Meddyl initiates a payout: generally, Meddyl will calculate the payout to the Host, by applying the Base Exchange Rate on the date that Meddyl initiates the payout to the Accommodation Fees (less Meddyl's Host Fees and any Taxes in respect of the Host Fees, such as VAT in Europe) in the Listing Currency. The Host will be able to view the actual exchange rate applied in his or her transaction history in the Site or Application. In some cases where the payout method selected by the Host involves certain third-party payment processors (such as Western Union), (i) Meddyl will send the payout amount to the processor in a major currency (e.g. US dollars), by applying the relevant Base Exchange Rate for the Listing Currency to that major currency, (ii) the Host will be able to view the payout amount sent by Meddyl in that major currency in his or her transaction history in the Site or Application, and (iii) the processor will calculate the actual payout to the Host by applying its own foreign currency conversion rate for that major currency to the Payout Currency.</li>
            <br />
            <li>When a confirmed booking is modified or cancelled, and there had been a foreign currency conversion when the booking was submitted: the foreign currency conversion for any additional payments required of the Guest or any refund to the Guest will be processed at the same rate as applied to the earlier payment by the Guest.</li>
            <br />
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>When you as a Guest submit a booking request for a Listing, you will be able to view the actual exchange rate used to calculate the Total Fees in the Booking Currency. Where the Adjusted Exchange Rate is applied, you will be able to view the mark-up included in the rate. The actual exchange rate (and any mark-up included in the rate) will also be stated in the billing receipt for your booking.</p>

    <p>Meddyl updates the Base Exchange Rate on a regular basis, but not on a real-time basis. In particular, Meddyl does not always change the Base Exchange Rate immediately when its costs of foreign exchange change. Accordingly, the Base Exchange Rate may not be identical to the applicable market rate in effect at the specific time a foreign currency conversion is processed.</p>

    <p>Please note that your payment company (for example, your credit or bank card issuer) will use a currency conversion rate for and may impose a currency conversion fee on your payment or payout, if your card or bank account is denominated in a currency that is different from the Booking Currency or the Payout Currency respectively. Similarly, third-party payment processors may also use a currency conversion rate for or impose a currency conversion fee on your payment or payout. All of these currency conversion rates and fees are not controlled by or known to Meddyl.</p>

    <p>You and Meddyl agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the Services or use of the Site or Application (collectively, "<b>Disputes</b>") will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and Meddyl are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Meddyl otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>

    <p><u>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law</u>. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("<b>AAA</b>") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "<b>AAA Rules</b>") then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section. (The AAA Rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org/arb_med" target="_blank">www.adr.org/arb_med</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.</p>

    <p><u>Arbitration Process</u>. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a <a href="http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175">form Demand for Arbitration</a> and a separate <a href="http://adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004314">form for California residents</a>) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>

    <p><u>Arbitration Location and Procedure</u>. Unless you and Meddyl otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Meddyl submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>

    <p><u>Arbitrator's Decision</u>. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's award damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Meddyl will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>

    <p><u>Fees</u>. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Meddyl will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>

    <p><u>Changes</u>. Notwithstanding the provisions of the "Modification" section above, if Meddyl changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Last Updated Date" above or in the date of Meddyl's email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Meddyl in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>

    <p><b>General</b></p>

    <p>The failure of Meddyl to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Meddyl. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>

    <p><b>Third party beneficiary</b></p>

    <p>These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that the payment card networks are third party beneficiaries of these Terms for purposes of enforcing provisions related to payments, but that their consent or agreement is not necessary for any changes or modifications to these Terms.</p>
